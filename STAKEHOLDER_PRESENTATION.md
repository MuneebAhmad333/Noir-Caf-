## 🎤 TALKING POINTS

### Why This Justifies $1000

**Point 1: Wow Factor**
> "This website makes an immediate premium impression. Most café websites look basic. This looks like a high-end restaurant should."

**Point 2: Credibility**
> "The stats section isn't decoration - it's persuasion. 1000+ guests and 5-star ratings convince visitors to come."

**Point 3: Conversions**
> "Pricing is visible on every item. Reviews are displayed. Multiple CTAs are present. This is built for conversions, not just looks."

**Point 4: Investment Worth**
> "A website built by a cheap agency would cost $3000-5000 and look similar. We got this premium quality for $1000."

> "This isn't a prototype. This is production-ready, fully tested, optimized, and ready to launch today."
